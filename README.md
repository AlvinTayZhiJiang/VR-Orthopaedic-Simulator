# Virtual Reality Orthopaedic Simulator (Ongoing)
As part of a module in my second major in innovation and design (iDP), my team and I are working towards the development of a Virtual Reality (VR) Orthopaedic Simulator, using Unity and Occulus Quest, to help Orthopaedic residents gain more experience and familiarity in clinical procedures, as well as receive real-time feedback from their consultants.

We explored the prototyping of:
1. A conversational agent using RASA
2. Facial expression using Blender
3. Animation creation for virtual characters from motion capture using Microsoft (MS) Kinect
4. Animation creation for virtual characters from motion capture using Vicon Motion Capture (MX) System

### Files in the respository
1. **Design Templates/ Design Template A, B, C.pdf:** Design thinking workflows and templates submitted
2. **VR Orthopedic_Interim_Report.pdf:** Interim report
3. **Patient_Mark.stl**: Modelling of facial expressions using Blender to test out the use of facial expressions in VR to enhance realism
