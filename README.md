# Virtual Reality Orthopaedic Simulator (Ongoing)
As part of a module in my second major in innovation and design (iDP), my team and I is working towards the development of a Virtual Reality (VR) Orthopaedic Simulator, using Unity and C#, to help Orthopaedic residents gain more experience and familiarity in clinical procedures, as well as receive real-time feedback from their consultants.
